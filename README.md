This repository is not meant to be a working project - in fact it almost certaintly will not work as intended 

The purpose of this repository is to show my implementations of some of the interesting projects I got to work on during my Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Iowa (hence the name, cs4420)

This project is also meant to be a reference source for me. There were some challenging concepts discussed in this course, and I'm sure I will be revisiting this repository as I continue learning about Artificial Intelligence
